  Gyul! Hap! Match 3
</h1>

Gyul! Hap! is based on a game from the Korean Show [The Genius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Genius_(TV_series)).

A Gyul! Hap! puzzle consists of a grid of nine tiles, where each tile is defined by a shape color, shape, and background color. A "Hap" is a set of three tiles where each property (shape color, shape, background color) is either all the same or all different between the three tiles. For example, a red triangle on a blue background, a blue triangle on a blue background, and a yellow triangle on a blue background form a "Hap" because the shape colors are all different, and the shapes and background colors are all the same. A correct "Hap" earns 1 point, and an incorrect "Hap" loses 1 point. Points cannot decrease below 0.

A "Gyul" can be called when all matches have been found (or in a rare instance, there were no matches initially), ending the game. A correct "Gyul" earns 3 points, and an incorrect "Gyul" loses 2 points.
